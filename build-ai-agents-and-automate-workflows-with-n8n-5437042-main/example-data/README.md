## About the Data

The data contained in both CSV files (`Volunteer-Index-Full.csv` and `Volunteer-Index-Short.csv`) is entirely fictitious and has been generated using artificial intelligence for demonstration and educational purposes only. Any resemblance to real persons, living or deceased, or actual events is purely coincidental. This data should not be used for any real-world volunteer management or contact purposes.

The phone numbers, email addresses, and personal information are completely fabricated and do not correspond to any real individuals or organizations.

## Usage Notes

- The "Short" dataset contains 9 volunteer records (a subset of the full dataset)
- Both files use the same data structure for consistency
- The data is designed to be used with n8n workflows and automation examples
- All email addresses use the placeholder domain `@example.com`
- All phone numbers follow the format `555-555-XXXX`
